# Amsterdam-Travel-Web-Site-ASP.Net-Core-MVC
We wanted to make a site that guides people who want to go to Amsterdam to complete their work before starting the journey and to do activities during their trip.
Bon Voyage means have a good journey. Like the name of our page, we aimed to ensure that our users can get information about the city before they go and make their plans according to the city by seeing the places to visit so that they can have a good trip. If they want to start the process to go and do not know where to start, they will find their answers on our site.
Thanks to the new functions we added, our site has become dynamic and the factors that make it dynamic are: routing, razor, view component, view model, partial view, layout, section and entity framework. 
### Some features we added
## Routing
We direct the views through the controller.
## Razor
Thanks to Razor, we can use c# and html codes together.
## ViewModel 
We are taking the admin information on our Contact Us page using viewmodel.
## Partial View
We used the partial view part to make our website dynamic and to adapt it later if we want to make 
changes to our reservation page.
## Layout
We get the header and footer parts of all our dynamic pages using layout.
## ViewComponent
The total recommendation part on our recommendation page was made with the viewcomponent. 
The “total recommendation” value is updated after each CRUD operation.
## Section
On our thanks page, which we directed to our users after purchasing their tickets, the above text 
"Thank you for choosing us. Please check your e-mail addresses. We prepared a list according to 
your requests." part is section.
## Entity Framework
We add the information and comments of our users to the database we created using the dbcontext 
class together with the Entity framework.
